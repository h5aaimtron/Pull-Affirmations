# Pull Affirmations

This repository exists to let GitHub users practice pull requests. The workflow will auto-accept pull requests that contain only .txt files with the total size less than 5kb. If your request meets this simple criteria, the pull request will be accepted and a positive affirmation from the affirmations.txt file will be the comment on acceptance. Please note, your change will not actually be merged to protect the integrity of the repository. Yes, this is a silly little project, but its about the positivity, and maybe the silly.
